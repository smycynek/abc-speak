# ABC Speak

Copyright 2021 Steven Mycynek

## Basics

This was just a fun afternoon activity I did with my daughter -- mostly to see if I could actually get it up and running in an afternoon.  I found out that using the `Audio` object repeatedly in mobile can cause iOS Chrome/Safari to suddenly stop accepting click events, so I used the `AudioContext`, which was
a bit more work, but gave better results.
